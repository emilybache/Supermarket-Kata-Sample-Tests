Supermarket Kata Sample Tests
=============================

In this repo I've gathered some example test cases. They don't run or compile. The idea is to use them as a starting point for a conversation about good test design.

If you print out each example and pin them around the room, a group of people can walk around and discuss each one. This could be a good warmup exercise before attempting to do this Kata.

Try A4, Landscape, 20 point font. Print from an IDE to get syntax highlighting.
